                <h2>Why do we travel?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It all starts out with an urge to be somewhere that we’re not. And it’s often after we arrive in that somewhere (or when we return from it) that other reasons to travel arise.</p>
                <p>We travel for various reasons, but I think it’s interesting to note that vacations are often referred to as “getaways.” Most often, we travel to get away from something — be it a bad job, a relationship, a stereotype, or just a nagging sense of wanderlust. Sometimes, we don’t even realize that we are traveling to escape. But even just a short vacation to the beach or an unfamiliar city can serve as an escape — an escape from work, stress and responsibilities that we are weighed down with at home.</p>
                <p>Through this escape, a traveler often loosens up, allowing for exploration, discovery, and learning. We immerse ourselves in new cultures, try new foods, get ourselves into uncomfortable situations, and discover things about ourselves that we may find surprising. It is easy to get high off the sense of anonymity that can be experienced while on the road. It doesn’t matter if it’s a 5-day cruise or a year-long round-the-world trip — if nobody knows you, you often feel free to break out of your shell.</p>
                </p>

                <h2>Why travel in India?</h2>
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style: none; text-align: left;">
                    <li><h3>People</h3>
                        <p>The local people in India, particularly in the rural areas, are some of the kindest and most hospitable people I’ve encountered in all of my travels. Whether you’re invited into a local’s home for a traditional meal or just simply wander the streets and encounter children playing, you’ll surely be touched by the warmth of the locals.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>The Taj Mahal</h3>
                        <p>The Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, is the most iconic symbol of India and is, arguably, the most famous monument in the world. Built by the Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his favourite wife, this ‘teardrop on the face of eternity’ is widely considered one of the most beautiful architectural wonders ever created. A visit to this marble mausoleum needs to be on every traveller’s list.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>The Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        The food alone is reason enough to travel to India — I sampled some of the most delicious food I have ever tasted during my travels there. Indians take their food very seriously and the cuisine, just like the country itself, is incredibly diverse.In the North, you’ll taste lots of thick, creamy curries that are moderately spicy. My favourites include mutton rogan josh, parathas and tandoori chicken. The food in the north is heavily influenced by Persian and Mughlai styles of cooking.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h3>The <em>Holiest</em> river in the world</h3>
                    <p>The Ganges River runs 2,525 km from the northern Himalayas all the way to the Bay of Bengal. It is much more than a river to the one billion Hindus in India and beyond, however. It is their lifeblood. Not only does it provide sustenance in the form of fishing, industry and agriculture, it is also believed to transport the prayers of believers to heaven and a dip in the river is said to purify the soul.
